                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>20-year operating agreement</strong> - Long-term contractual control</p></li>

                </ul>

                <h3>What YOU should watch for</h3>
                <div class="warning-points">
                    <p><strong>Long-term contracts</strong> that lock in operational authority (especially in branding,
                        staffing, or day-to-day control) can signal that you're running the business, not just advising.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Regular access to client premises</strong> - Even without a lease or exclusive use of
                        space, regular access to client premises where business is actually conducted may give rise to
                        PE exposure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Operational control indicators</strong> - If your team is helping hire the GM, set
                        prices, manage procurement, approve SOPs, you're functionally running the show. Courts may not
                        treat that as "just consulting".</p>

                    <p><strong>Success-based fees</strong> mean skin in the game. When compensation is linked to
                        business performance, it's harder to argue passive advisory.</p>

                    <p><strong>Personnel rotation</strong> - It isn't just about one person's stay. Personnel rotating
                        with a continuous on-ground presence handling core operations increases exposure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Indian affiliate doesn't insulate</strong> the foreign parent if key decisions and
                        operational control still originate from the same premises. Courts focus on substance over
                        structure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Losses at group level</strong> don't shield a PE. It's treated as a separately taxable
                        presence, and attribution is based on activity (not consolidated results).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>The ITAT relied on SC decision in Formula One and emphasized <strong>right of

                    <li><p>Visits by multiple personnel, some staying up to 9 months, satisfied the functional presence

                    interest.</p>

                <p><strong>Distinguished E-Funds case:</strong> E-Funds involved auxiliary support services, unlike
                    Hyatt's direct role in implementing strategy, managing operations, and enforcing brand &
                    financial policies.</p>

                <p><strong>Rejected the idea</strong> that absence of designated physical space invalidated PE;
                    relied on Formula One case to hold that shared, temporary or non-exclusive use is sufficient if
                    business is conducted through it to establish PE.</p>

                <p>The taxpayer argued that since it had incurred global losses, no income could be attributed to
                    its alleged PE in India under Article 7. The High Court rejected this argument, holding that
                    taxability depends on the existence and functions of the PE in India and not on the overall
                    profitability of the foreign enterprise.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The taxpayer's activities transcended a mere advisory role and
                    extended to direct operational control, satisfying the test for a Fixed Place PE.</p>

                <h3>THE SUPREME COURT JUDGMENT</h3>

                <p><strong>Substantial question of law:</strong> Whether HISWA had a Fixed Place PE in India under
                    Article 5(1) of the India-UAE DTAA?</p>

                <h3>OBSERVATIONS ON THE SOSA AGREEMENT</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The SOSA was a long-term contract (20 years, extendable by 10) that granted HISWA
                        substantive operational authority.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The agreement conferred HISWA with rights to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Appoint and supervise key hotel personnel, including the General Manager;</p></li>
                            <li><p>Formulate and enforce policies on HR, procurement, branding, pricing, guest
                                experience, and bank account operations;</p></li>
                            <li><p>Deploy personnel (including affiliate employees) at its discretion, without
                                requiring consent from the hotel owner.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The consideration was linked to the hotel's financial performance (room revenue and gross
                        operating profit) rather than a fixed fee. This underscored a commercially participative
                        role.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>OBSERVATIONS ON CONCEPT OF PE</h3>
                <p>The Court reaffirmed the principles laid down in Formula One case that a Fixed Place PE exists
                    where a place is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>At the disposal of the foreign enterprise, and</p></li>
                    <li><p>Such place is used to carry on its business (wholly or partly).</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Supreme Court reiterated that the existence of a Fixed Place PE under Article 5(1) must be
                    assessed using three key criteria:</p>
                <div class="pe-criteria">
                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>Stability</h4>
                        <p>A sustained and continuous arrangement for conducting business from a particular location
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>Productivity</h4>
                        <p>Performance of revenue-generating functions at that location</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>Dependence</h4>
                        <p>A business presence that is functionally reliant on the use of the premises</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The fact that no single employee stayed in India beyond the 9 month threshold under Article
                    5(2)(i) was not decisive.</p>

                <p>The Court observed that <strong>continuity of business operations</strong> (even via multiple
                    personnel in rotation) was sufficient to support the existence of a PE.</p>

                <h3>ON THE MATTER OF ATTRIBUTION OF PROFITS DESPITE GLOBAL LOSSES</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The Court rejected the argument that no attribution of profits could be made because the
                        entity incurred global losses.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Citing the High Court's ruling (larger bench) on the same matter, the Supreme Court affirmed
                        that taxability in India arises from the existence and activity of the PE, not from
                        group-level profitability.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The PE is treated as a separately taxable presence in a foreign jurisdiction, and profits
                        attributable to it can be taxed in India regardless of the foreign entity's overall
                        financial position.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Supreme Court held that HISWA had a Fixed Place PE in India
                    under Article 5(1) of the India-UAE DTAA, based on its sustained operational control over key
                    hotel functions through a long-term agreement. It clarified that legal ownership or exclusive
                    possession of premises is not necessary - what matters is the right to access and use the
                    premises in the course of business with a sufficient degree of permanence. The Court also
                    rejected the plea that global losses preclude attribution, affirming that taxability flows from
                    the existence and activities of the PE itself.</p>
