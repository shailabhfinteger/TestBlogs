                <li>
                    <p><b>NEGOTIATION</b></p>
                    <p>The life cycle begins with negotiation. The two countries engage in preliminary discussions to decide if a tax treaty is desirable, often based on the level of trade and investment between them.</p>
                    <p>Both parties will share their respective draft - typically based on their preferred model tax treaties, such as the <span>OECD or UN Model</span> - and then proceed to review each article of the treaty in detail.</p>
                    <p>Provisions on which agreement is not reached immediately may be marked for further discussion. After multiple rounds of negotiation, on achieving consensus on the entire text, the treaty is <span>initialled by the negotiators</span> to signify provisional agreement on its contents.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><b>SIGNATURES</b></p>
                    <p>Following initialing, the treaty moves to signature. The countries arrange a <span>formal signing ceremony</span>, and an authorized high-level official signs the treaty on behalf of each government.</p>
                    <p>Signing signifies the countries' intent to be bound by the treaty, but <span>signature alone does not make the treaty law</span> – further approval is required in each country's domestic system.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><b>RATIFICATION AND EXCHANGE OF INSTRUMENTS</b></p>
                    <p>Ratification is the formal process by which a country officially confirms and accepts a treaty, making it <span>legally binding under international law</span> for that country.</p>
                    <p>After signing, each country must ratify the treaty according to its constitutional procedures. This typically involves <span>legislative or executive approval</span>: for example, one country's parliament may need to pass a law or the cabinet might issue a decree to approve the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Once both countries have completed their ratification process, they formally <span>exchange instruments of ratification</span>. The exchange of these instruments signifies that the treaty is conclusively accepted by both sides.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><b>ENTRY INTO FORCE AND ENTRY INTO EFFECT</b></p>
                    <p><span>Entry into force</span> refers to the moment the treaty becomes legally binding on the two countries. In the context of OECD/UN Model-based tax treaties (and most actual treaties), generally, <span>exchange of ratification instruments = entry into force</span> - unless the treaty provides for a different mechanism (e.g., entry into force occurs 30 days after the exchange).</p>
                    <p><span>Entry into effect</span> is the date starting which the treaty's provisions start to apply to taxpayers and taxable events. A treaty in force may specify that its terms only take effect from the start of the next tax year. Most treaties contain detailed effective date clauses (as a part of the Entry into Force clause).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Example from UAE-KSA DTAA</h3>

                        <p><b>Article 30 - Entry into force</b></p>
                        <p>Each Contracting State shall notify the other Contracting State in writing through diplomatic channels of the completion of the necessary procedures in accordance with its laws for the entry into force of this Convention. This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month next following the month in which the last notification has been received.</p>
                        <p><b>The provisions of this Convention shall apply:</b></p>
                        <p><b>A.</b> in respect of taxes withheld at source, on payments made on or after the first day of January following the date of entry into force of this Convention;</p>

                    <p><b>DURATION AND TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION</b></p>
                    <p>Once in force and effective, a tax treaty generally remains in operation <span>indefinitely</span> – there is usually no fixed end date. Instead, treaties include a termination clause outlining how either country can end the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Termination of tax treaties is not common, as treaties are important for <span>investor confidence</span>. However, it does happen occasionally.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Example: UAE-Germany DTAA Termination</h3>
                    <div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
                        <p><b>Article 30(1):</b> "This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten calendar years beginning on the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement entered into force according to paragraph 2 of Article 29. Thereafter, it shall remain in force for a further ten calendar years if both Contracting States have agreed to a prolongation and informed each other in writing by diplomatic channels, six months before expiry, that the internal requirements for a prolongation are fulfilled..."</p>
                        <p><span>Germany decided not to renew the agreement with the UAE</span> and therefore, UAE's DTAA with Germany expired on December 31, 2021.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Countries may renegotiate or update tax treaties by signing an <span>amending protocol</span>. A protocol is essentially a mini-treaty that modifies certain provisions - it must go through the same life cycle as explained earlier to become applicable and effective.</p>
