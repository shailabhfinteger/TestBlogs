            <h1>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich</h1>

            <h3>A landmark in international tax avoidance and its role in global reform</h3>
        </header>
        <main>



            <p>Among the numerous tax planning strategies developed over the past half century, few have achieved the
                notoriety of the ‚ÄúDouble Irish with a Dutch Sandwich‚Äù. Originating in the late 1980s and widely used
                until the 2010s, this arrangement allowed primarily USA-based technology and pharmaceutical
                multinationals to channel billions in profits to low- or
                no-tax jurisdictions. In doing so, it helped corporations achieve effective tax rates far below
                statutory levels, sometimes fractions of a percent.</p>
            <p>More than just an accounting manoeuvre, the strategy became emblematic of aggressive tax avoidance. It
                illustrated how mismatches between national tax systems, coupled with creative exploitation of treaties
                and directives, could create ‚Äústateless income‚Äù untaxed anywhere in the world. Its widespread adoption
                drew unprecedented scrutiny from policymakers, academics, and civil society, ultimately becoming one of
                the most important catalysts for the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (‚ÄúBEPS‚Äù) initiative
                launched in 2013.</p>

                    <p><b>MECHANICS</b></p>


                    <p>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich relied on <b>four tightly interlinked components
                        </b>that worked in unison to channel profits away from high-tax jurisdictions. This structure
                        effectively created a funnel, moving income from operating markets into entities located in low
                        or no-tax havens. By carefully exploiting mismatches in tax-residency rules, royalty payments,
                        and treaty provisions, the structure enabled companies to move income seamlessly across borders.

                    <h3>STEP I: <span>Establishing Irish subsidiaries</span>
                    </h3>



                    <p>
                        Irish Co. 1: Incorporated <span>in Ireland but </span>managed and controlled
                        <span>from a tax haven (commonly Bermuda). Under Ireland‚Äôs pre-2015 rules, tax-residency
                            depended on management and control, not incorporation. Thus, Irish Co. 1 was deemed
                            Bermuda-resident and outside the scope of Irish tax. The USA, meanwhile, treated it as a
                            foreign corporation, deferring tax until repatriation.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Irish Co. 2: <span>Incorporated and tax-resident in Ireland, responsible for European sales,
                            distribution, or services.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>This dual structure created a split: <span>one Irish company with a tax- residency in Bermuda
                            (tax haven) for tax purposes, and another, which is the tax-resident in Ireland, bearing
                            only minimal taxable income.</span>
                    </p>

                    <h3>STEP II: <span>Intellectual Property licensing</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>The USA parent company </span>
                        <span>transferred valuable IP </span>

                        <span>Irish Co. 1</span>
                        <span>, typically at a low historic cost. Irish Co. 1 then granted a </span>
                        <span>master license </span>
                        <span>to </span>
                        <span>Dutch Co</span>
                        <span>, which in turn </span>
                        <span>sub-licensed </span>
                        <span>the IP to</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>Irish Co. 2 </span>
                        <span>in return for substantial royalty payments. These royalties were </span>
                        <span>deliberately structured </span>
                        <span>to </span>

                    <p>
                        <span>Consequently, even though Irish Co. 2 generated revenues that could run into billions, it
                            reported only minimal taxable income in Ireland.</span>
                    </p>

                    <h3>STEP III: <span>The Dutch sandwich</span>
                    </h3>



                    <p>Any <span>direct royalty payments </span>from Irish Co. 2 to Irish Co. 1 would have triggered
                        Irish <span>withholding tax </span>of up to 20%. To circumvent this, the royalties were first
                        routed through a <span>Dutch affiliate </span>(thanks to the <span>EU Interest and Royalties
                            Directive </span>and the <span>Ireland‚ÄìNetherlands tax treaty</span>, <span>no withholding
                            tax </span>applied on payments from Ireland to the Netherlands).</p>
                    <p>At the time, Dutch domestic tax law <span>did not impose withholding tax on outbound royalty
                            payments</span>. As a result, once royalties reached the Dutch affiliate, they could be
                        passed on to Bermuda without an additional tax charge.</p>

                        <span>The royalties ultimately flowed to </span>
                        <span>Irish Co. 1</span>
                        <span>, which was treated as Bermuda tax-resident. Given Bermuda‚Äôs 0% corporate tax rate, these

                        <span>The combined effect was </span>

                    <p><b>HISTORICAL USE AND NOTABLE EXAMPLES</b></p>
                    <p>The Double Irish gained wide traction across IP-driven industries during the 1990s and 2000s, and
                        by 2010 it had become a cornerstone of the tax planning strategies used by major Silicon Valley
                        companies. Offshore earnings of USA based multinationals swelled to unprecedented levels, with
                        Fortune 500 firms collectively holding about $2.6 trillion offshore by 2017, much of it
                        attributable to arrangements of this kind.</p>

                    <h3>APPLE</h3>


                    <p>Apple‚Äôs deployment of the Double Irish structure became a global flashpoint. Two
                        Irish-incorporated companies, managed from the USA, claimed tax-residency in neither Ireland nor
                        the USA.</p>
                    <p>Between 2003 and 2014, <span>Apple‚Äôs effective tax rate </span>on <span>European profits
                        </span>plummeted from roughly <span>1% </span>to just <span>0.005%</span>. In 2016, the European
                        Commission ruled that Ireland had granted Apple unlawful State aid and ordered recovery of ‚Ç¨13
                        billion plus interest.</p>
                    <p>That ruling was ultimately upheld by the EU‚Äôs highest court in</p>
                    <p>2024, cementing Apple‚Äôs arrangement as one of the most striking examples of aggressive tax
                        avoidance.</p>

                    <h3>OTHER FIRMS AND VARIANTS</h3>



                    <p>Microsoft, Facebook, and major pharmaceutical groups also relied on the structure. When Ireland
                        closed the loophole to new entrants in 2015 and to legacy users by 2020, companies experimented
                        with alternatives.</p>

                    <p>The Single Malt <span>used treaties with Malta or the UAE to replicate double
                            non-taxation.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Green Jersey <span>leveraged Irish capital allowances for intangibles to offset profits
                            domestically.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Both faced pushback:</p>

                            <p>The Green Jersey <span>remains available, but since 2017 its </span>use has been
                                restricted
                                <span>by an 80% cap on allowances, leaving at least 20% of profits taxable in
                                    Ireland.</span>
                            </p>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>THE SINGLE MALT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Single Malt emerged after Ireland announced the closure of the Double Irish (to new
                            users from 2015, with legacy users phased out by 2020). Tax planners sought new
                            stateless-income tools and identified treaty mismatches offering a workaround.</li>
                        <li>It relied on an Irish-incorporated entity that was "neither tax-resident in Ireland nor in
                            the treaty partner country" (e.g., Malta or the UAE), using Ireland's management-and-control
                            rules and treaty definitions to become resident nowhere for tax purposes.</li>
                        <li>That same entity, despite being resident nowhere, qualified under tax treaties (e.g.,
                            Ireland‚ÄîMalta) to receive payments without triggering withholding taxes, effectively
                            replicating the Double Irish's offshore carve-out in a simpler form.</li>

                    <p>The OECD/G20 BEPS Project, launched in 2013, directly targeted the mechanisms the Double Irish
                        exploited. Relevant Actions included:</p>



                    <p>The Double Irish, though never cited in legislation by name, was repeatedly referenced in
                        hearings, speeches, and policy papers - emerging as the defining symbol, the very ‚Äúposter
                        child,‚Äù of the global BEPS debate.</p>

                            <p>Ireland reformed its residency rules in 2015, requiring all Irish- incorporated companies
                                to be tax-resident in Ireland (with a transition period until 2020), eventually ending
                                the ‚Äústateless‚Äù company model. Ireland also signed the Multilateral Instrument (‚ÄúMLI‚Äù),
                                incorporating the Principal Purpose Test (‚ÄúPPT‚Äù) into treaties to curb treaty shopping.
                                The Single Malt loophole with Malta was closed in 2019; similar risks with other
                                partners, such as the UAE, have been addressed.</p>

                            <p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (‚ÄúGCC‚Äù), long home to low-tax regimes, could have served as
                                replacement havens. Ireland‚Äôs treaty with the UAE was identified as vulnerable. However,
                                GCC states joined the BEPS Inclusive Framework and signed the MLI.</p>
                            <p>The UAE introduced a 9% federal corporate tax in 2023 and committed to the 15% minimum
                                tax. Saudi Arabia and Qatar strengthened anti-abuse clauses in treaties. While
                                maintaining investment-friendly zones, GCC countries are aligning with BEPS standards
                                and conduit benefits are expected to be neutralized by Pillar II top-up taxes.</p>

                    <p>
                        By 2020, the Double Irish was effectively extinct. Companies adapted in various ways:

                        <li>Google and others onshored IP to the USA after the 2017 tax reforms reduced incentives for
                            offshore holding.</li>
                        <li>Single Malt and Green Jersey variants emerged but were curtailed by treaty updates and
                            domestic reforms.</li>
                        <li>Some pursued corporate inversions, but tightened USA rules diminished appeal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>LONG-TERM IMPACT</b></p>
                    <p><b>STRUCTURAL REFORM:</b> The BEPS package, MLI, and now BEPS 2.0‚Äôs Pillars I and II directly
                        address the issues exposed. Pillar One reallocates taxing rights to markets, while Pillar II
                        ensures a minimum tax of 15%. Had such rules existed earlier, Apple‚Äôs 0.005% rate in Ireland
                        would have triggered a top-up tax elsewhere.</p>

                    <p><b>FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE:</b> Authorities now demand alignment between profits and DEMPE functions.
                        Country-by-country reporting increases transparency. IP licensing arrangements face closer
                        scrutiny.</p>






                    <p>For Ireland, closing the Double Irish marked a shift from haven perception to compliant
                        hub. Its 12.5% rate, EU access, and skilled workforce continue to attract investment,
                        demonstrating that credibility and stability can substitute for loopholes.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
                </li>
                <p>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich was a masterclass in exploiting mismatched rules, but its
                    very success ensured its demise. By allowing multinationals to pay almost no tax on vast global
                    profits, it crystallized the urgency of reform and ushered in the BEPS era.</p>
                <p>The global response has been sweeping: treaties carry anti-abuse clauses, domestic laws embed
                    anti-hybrid rules and GAAR, and Pillar II sets a 15% floor. The scope for stateless income has
                    narrowed, even as planners search for new avenues.</p>
                <p>With over 140 jurisdictions in the Inclusive Framework, the global minimum tax is now a
                    coordinated reality. The Double Irish‚Äôs legacy is both cautionary and instructive: it showcases
                    the ingenuity of planners and the need for vigilance, and it proves that international
                    cooperation can close gaps and restore fairness.</p>
                <p>Its demise marks not just the end of a structure, but the beginning of a more resilient,
                    cooperative international tax order.</p>
